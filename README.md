# Transforming data for Tableau
## First task during internship at Level Group

---

The task was divided into two stages. First, I had to modify an Excel spreadsheet. Then, I needed to write a Python script that would create a new table to be loaded into Tableau.

### Stage 1: Modifying the Excel Spreadsheet
- **Objective**: Update an existing Excel spreadsheet to meet new requirements.
- **Steps**:
  - Analyze the current structure and content of the Excel file.

  - Identify the necessary changes based on the provided specifications.
  - Implement the modifications, which may include adding new columns, updating data, and applying formulas.
  - Ensure the data integrity and accuracy after making the changes.

#### Stage 2: Writing a Python Script
- **Objective**: Create a Python script that generates a new table for Tableau.
- **Steps**:
  - Design the script to read data from the modified Excel spreadsheet.
  - Process the data as required for the Tableau visualization, which might involve data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation.
  - Write the processed data to a new Excel file or directly to a format compatible with Tableau.
  - Test the script to ensure it correctly generates the desired output.
  - Verify that the new table loads correctly into Tableau and displays the expected results.
